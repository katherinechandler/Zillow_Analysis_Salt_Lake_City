# Living small in the city or large in the 'burbs?
## MVP Summary
#### Katherine Chandler, K2 Exploratory Data Analysis

## Background
The small home movement suggests that small urban homes are a better asset than large suburban homes, but is this economic reality? Is a small urban home *really* a better investment than a large suburban home? This question was addressed using current and historical real estate prices for the Salt Lake City area obtained from the real estate market place Zillow.

## Questions for Exploration

This question was addressed as three discrete sub-questions:

* Are small homes more valuable (per square foot) than large homes?
* Is a small home downtown really more valuable than a large home in the 'burbs?
* Has the relative value of small urban homes increased more than that of large suburban homes?



#### Question 1. Are small homes more valuable (per square foot) than large homes?

![**Figure 1. Price per Square Foot by Home Size**](/Users/jeff/Desktop/K2_DataScience/K2_Project2/SLC_home_price_figures/Figure_4.png)

The mean price per square foot for a home less than 1200 sqft ('small') is \$249, greater than that of either 'medium' sized homes (\$195) or 'large' homes (\$208). **Relative to their size, small homes are more valuable than large homes**.



#### Question 2: Is a small home downtown really more valuable than a large home in the 'burbs?

The price per square foot for home size categories (small, medium, and large) were plotted for three Salt Lake City regions: downtown, the eastern suburbs, and the western suburbs.

![**Figure 2. Price per Square Foot by Size Category and Region**](/Users/jeff/Desktop/K2_DataScience/K2_Project2/SLC_home_price_figures/Figure_5a.png)

**Yes, a small home downtown is more valuable (relative to size) than a large house in the suburbs.** The median price per square foot for a small home in Downtown-SLC is \$304 while large homes in East-SLC and West-SLC are priced at \$216 and \$128, respectively. 

While a small home downtown is more valuable than a large home in the suburbs, a small home in Downtown-SLC is *not* more valuable (per square foot) than a small home in an eastern suburb. In fact, the most valuable asset type in this data is a small home in the suburb of Cottonwood (data not shown), with a median price per square foot of \$379.



#### Question 3: Has the relative value of small urban homes increased more than that of large suburban homes?

The normalized Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) was plotted for small homes downtown versus large homes in each of the two suburban regions (east and west).

Owning a large home in a fancy suburb is actually better than owning a small home downtown, but owning a small home downtown is usually better than owning a large home in a less desirable suburb.

Relative to large homes in both suburban regions, small homes downtown did not appreciate as dramatically during the 2006-2009 boom. During the economic downturn in 2009, however, urban small homes maintained their value as well as large homes in suburban East-SLC and much better than large homes in suburban West-SLC.

It is noteworthy that in this current market upswing (2013 to present) the ZHVI appreciation of small urban homes is catching up to that of large suburban homes. The 2018 data shows small homes at their highest valuation since 1996, while large suburban homes are appreciated to roughly the same valuation as during the 2006-2009 bubble.

Is it better to own a small home downtown than a large home in the suburbs? The answer depends on the specific suburb and the market trajectory, but in the context of Salt Lake City and the current market boom it is **likely that small urban homes are a better investment than large suburban homes**. Small urban homes how have with the highest appreciation values since 1996 and a high likelihood of maintaining value well in the next downturn.

## Summary

* Are small homes more valuable (per square foot) than large homes?
    
    **Yes.**
    
    
* Is a small home downtown really more valuable than a large home in the 'burbs? 
    
    **Yes, but surprisingly a small home in a fancy suburb is worth more!**


* Has the relative value of small urban homes increased more rapidly than that of larger suburban homes?
    
    **Not in previous real estate bubbles, but in the current market small urban homes have appreciated to their 
    highest value since 1996. Additionally, price behavior in past downturns indicate that small urban homes
    maintain their value as well or better than other property types during market corrections.** 
    
## Limitations and Further Exploration

* These data do not include actual sales price data, which is not publically available in the state of Utah.

* The historical price data is not complete for all ZIP codes and home types in this analysis.

* Further analysis could explore the year-over-year rate of change for ZHVI and add additional category classifiers, such as condo/ single family, the age of the home, the lot size, and neighborhood demographic features.
